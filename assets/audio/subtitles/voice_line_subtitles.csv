VOICE FILE,SUBTITLE
00_01,"When I was around seven, I made myself one of those time capsules for when I turned 28 years old."
00_02,"Perhaps I found it funny to avoid a multiple of ten, or maybe I was manifesting to make it past the 27 club."
00_03,"As per usual, I’ve left things to the last minute- today, it’s my 28th birthday."
01_01,Spongebob was my idol. My mom kept a box of my drawings filled with him.
01_02,I’d do Bikini Bottom meets Star Wars. Calling it terrifying is an understatement.
01_E01,It’s weird being back.
02_01,"I went to my cousin’s and watched him play the Bioshock demo, both of us in complete silence."
02_02,I spent the entire weekend reading the lore- I was obsessed!
02_03,"Next time Agathe came over, I told her all about it and she fell in love with it too."
02_04,That’s when I knew she was my best friend.
02_E01,"Seeing this, I can almost feel it,"
02_E02,the excitement rippling through my body. I was full of that as a kid.
02_E03,I miss that.
03_01,"Agathe drove me crazy. I had this huge crush on Marty Mcfly, I made her promise not to tell anyone."
03_02,"Of course, over dinner with my mom, she announces it, loud and clear."
03_03,My mom says ‘That’s why you’re always asking to watch Back To The Future’.
03_04,I died.
03_E01,The last time I saw Agathe was when she asked me if I was going to her wedding.
03_E02, I don’t even remember what my excuse was.
04_01,"Whenever my mom brushed my hair- fuck, it hurt! "
04_02,I‘d run away and find the first closet to hide in.
04_03,"I kinda enjoyed that, having her think I’d gone missing, calling out my name. "
04_04,Or at least until I heard the panic in her voice.
04_05,"I’d come out, crying, pleading with her not to be mad at me- or to brush my hair."
05_01,I was surprised I never got caught.
05_02,I probably saw most David Lynch films by the age of nine-
05_03,I think that explains a lot.
05_04,"One night, she watched that 2012 movie."
05_05,"At night I was paralyzed, knowing we only had three years left before the end of the world."
06_01,"So instead of sleeping, I’d be on my DS."
06_02,Whenever my mom walked in I’d unfortunately always get caught-
06_03,"since muffled underneath my head, the game’s music would continue playing.So instead of sleeping, I’d be on my DS."
06_I01,"Wait- that’s the box, the memory capsule!"
06_I02,It was for a class- we had to write a letter.
06_I03,"If I remember correctly, we were supposed to present it in class,"
06_I04,"and then, optionally, bury it somewhere for our future selves."
07_01,And this was me- rehearsing for the presentation! I was reading and rewriting it over and over again.
07_02,It wasn’t because I was nervous- I was one of those weird kids who loved presenting. 
07_03,"It didn’t matter if it was about my hopes and dreams or Napoleon, "
07_04,I'd be the first to raise my hand.
07_E01,"Nowadays, I don’t really tell people much of anything."
07_E02,"Coming here, I somehow forgot to tell everyone about it."
08_01,"The day of my presentation, I had to skip school to go to the embassy with my mom."
08_02,"I broke down, crying, screaming,"
08_03,tried hiding in the closet- she had to drag me out of the house. 
08_E01,"That night, she let me sleep beside her."
08_E02,"She promised me first thing in the morning we’d dig the capsule in the ground, together."
09_01,It’s hard to say exactly when it started.
09_02,"If it was when Agathe stopped me with an embarrassed smile in the metro,"
09_03,"saying, “You know, there’s other people in here.”"
09_04,Or that disgusted look on Claire’s face
09_05,when I mentioned playing World of Warcraft over the weekend.
09_06,"Or maybe when I was around ten years old,"
09_07,and my teacher called me a bitch in front of the whole class.
09_08,"It’s hard to say when I started hiding what I loved most, to dull myself down."
09_09,"For the past twenty years, everyday I’ve taken one little step away from myself."
09_10,"And whoever this is, standing here in these shoes, "
09_11,feeling the weight of this body against the ground-
09_12,I’m not so sure.
09_E01,"I guess I’m here because more than the fear of losing these walls,"
09_E02,or even the time capsule itself- what I’m scared of losing most
09_E03,is my way back home again.
10_01,"She put it away? I mean, maybe she thought it would get rained on"
10_02,or destroyed- but I don’t remember this.
10_E01,"Oh, right- I saw her. But I didn’t understand why she’d do that."
10_E02,"I took it as a sign, that the world was conspiring against me"
10_E03,stopping me from communicating with my future self.
10_E04,So I took it. I brought it inside.
10_E05,And I read it that night- maybe twenty times.
10_E06,"And again the day after, another fifty times."
10_E07,I read it- over and over again.
10_E08,"I read it until I didn’t need to look at it anymore,"
10_E09,so that no one could take it from me.
10_E10,"So that- when I was 28 years old, and the capsule was long gone,"
10_E11,"That if I looked back,"
10_E12,I would hear her again.
